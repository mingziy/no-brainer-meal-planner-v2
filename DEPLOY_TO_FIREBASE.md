# 🚀 Deploy to Firebase Hosting

## Quick Deployment Guide

Your app is ready to deploy! Follow these steps to make it accessible from anywhere.

---

## 📋 **Prerequisites:**

- ✅ Firebase CLI installed (already done!)
- ✅ Firebase project created (meal-planer-v2)
- ✅ App working locally
- ✅ Recipe saved to database

---

## 🚀 **Step-by-Step Deployment:**

### **Step 1: Login to Firebase**

In your terminal, run:

```bash
firebase login
```

- A browser window will open
- Sign in with your Google account
- Grant Firebase CLI permissions
- You'll see "Success! Logged in as your-email@gmail.com"

---

### **Step 2: Initialize Firebase Hosting**

```bash
firebase init hosting
```

You'll be asked several questions. Answer like this:

1. **"Please select an option"**
   - Choose: `Use an existing project`

2. **"Select a default Firebase project"**
   - Choose: `meal-planer-v2`

3. **"What do you want to use as your public directory?"**
   - Type: `dist`
   - Press Enter

4. **"Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)?"**
   - Type: `y` (YES)
   - Press Enter

5. **"Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub?"**
   - Type: `n` (NO)
   - Press Enter

6. **"File dist/index.html already exists. Overwrite?"**
   - Type: `n` (NO) - if this appears
   - Press Enter

---

### **Step 3: Build Your App**

This creates the production-ready files:

```bash
npm run build
```

You'll see:
```
✓ built in XXXms
dist/index.html          XX kb
...
```

---

### **Step 4: Deploy to Firebase!**

```bash
firebase deploy
```

Wait for it to complete (usually 30-60 seconds).

You'll see:
```
✔  Deploy complete!
