### Image Selector Scrolling Fix
- Fixed **"not scrollable, not starting from beginning"** issue in image selector:
  - Root cause: `max-h-[85vh]` Tailwind class wasn't constraining height properly
  - Solution: Used inline `style={{ maxHeight: '85vh', height: 'auto' }}`
  - Proper flexbox structure:
    - `DialogContent`: `flex flex-col` with `overflow-hidden`
    - `DialogHeader`: `flex-shrink-0` to stay fixed at top
    - Scrollable content: `flex-1 overflow-y-auto min-h-0` with `WebkitOverflowScrolling: 'touch'`
  - Added `onOpenAutoFocus={(e) => e.preventDefault()}` to prevent auto-focus issues
- Applied same fix to URL/Paste recipe add page image selector
