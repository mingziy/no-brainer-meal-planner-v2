# 🔧 Fix Firebase Auth Error - FIXED!

## ✅ **SOLUTION APPLIED: Switched to Redirect-Based Auth**

I've updated your app to use **redirect-based authentication** instead of popup-based. This fixes the error you were seeing!

## What Changed:
- ❌ Old: Popup-based sign-in (caused sessionStorage errors)
- ✅ New: Redirect-based sign-in (more reliable, no popup issues)

---

## Error You Were Seeing:
```
Unable to process request due to missing initial state. This may happen if browser sessionStorage is inaccessible or accidentally cleared.
```

This happened because popup-based auth has issues with browser security and sessionStorage.

### **Step 1: Go to Firebase Console**
1. Open: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project: **meal-planer-v2**
3. Click **Authentication** in the left sidebar

### **Step 2: Add Authorized Domains**
1. Click the **Settings** tab (next to "Users" tab)
2. Scroll down to **Authorized domains**
3. Click **Add domain**
4. Add: `localhost`
5. Click **Add**

### **Step 3: Refresh Your App**
1. Go back to http://localhost:3000
2. Hard refresh: **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows)
3. Try signing in again

## 🔄 **Alternative: Use Redirect Instead of Popup**

If the above doesn't work, we can switch to redirect-based authentication (more reliable):

The issue might be that popup-based auth is blocked by your browser. Let me know if you need to switch to redirect mode!

## 🐛 **Other Possible Causes:**

### **1. Browser Blocking Popups**
- Check if your browser is blocking popups
- Look for a blocked popup icon in the address bar
- Allow popups for localhost

### **2. Third-Party Cookies**
- Some browsers block third-party cookies
- Try in Chrome if you're using Safari
- Or enable third-party cookies temporarily

### **3. Browser Extensions**
- Privacy extensions might block Firebase Auth
- Try in an incognito/private window
- Or disable privacy extensions temporarily

## 🎯 **Quick Test:**

After adding `localhost` to authorized domains, try these browsers in order:
1. ✅ Chrome (best Firebase support)
2. ✅ Firefox
3. ⚠️ Safari (sometimes has issues)

---

## 💡 **New Sign-In Flow (Redirect-Based):**

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. **Page redirects to Google sign-in** (entire page, not a popup)
4. Choose your Google account on Google's page
5. **Redirects back to your app**
6. You're signed in! 🎉

**Much more reliable than popup-based auth!** ✅

---

## 🆘 **Still Not Working?**

Try this:
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Close all browser tabs
3. Restart your browser
4. Try again

Or let me know and I can switch to redirect-based auth instead of popup!
